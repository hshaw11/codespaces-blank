# I think technology has definitely change how we learn in school over the years it has made a huge difference in this generation. Using technology has made it so much easier to do work even when at home when you can't come to school you can still do your work from home. Also teachers may not like this but you can even use app to get work done so much easier instead of having try and figure it out yourself. Having the technology we have made school so easy and it was definitely was alot harder back in the early 2000 then it is now and its just going to be even better in the future.


# Some ways technology can help people learn is apps their are so many apps you can use to teach you how to do some work for school. Also youtube you can watch a youtube video to learn how to cook a meal. You can also watch a video and learn how to build stuff like if your trying to put together a new bed you just got you can look it up on youtube and you can put it together. It is just so much easier to learn using technology than trying to learn without technology.
