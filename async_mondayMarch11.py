# 3. You have been hired by a University to create

# conditions; 
# - If the user has never gotten a loan before and,
#-  if the user has never been to college before.
# The client would like you to use the logical NOT operator that will
# compare the condtions and return false. If the result is false, the client
# would also like the program to print the message "congrats! you've gotten the scholarship."
# the client has given you the choice on how to enter data for your function.
# you may enter data using input or pass in data into your function as parameters.

# Conditions Statements (if/elif/else)
#- we can output outcomes for specific conditions

# input- allow us to PUT IN data.

# print- sends data out.
# we need to print the message:
# "congrats! you've gotten the scholarship."

# Function - set of instructions that will run when called.

# Compare --> Logical operators- the question is telling
