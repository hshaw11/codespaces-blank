#1. What built-in function would you use if you wanted
# to print out data to a user?
The built-in function I would use is print
#2. What built-in function would you use if you wanted 
# a user to pass in data to a program?
The built-in function I would use is Input
#3. Explain what complexity and abstraction are, then 
# provide an example describing their relationship to one another.
# You cannot use the following examples because they 
# were shared in class; grocery/ electronics store, car, phone. 
An abstraction is a simplified representation of something more complex and complexity is a field from computer science which analyzes algorithms based on the amount resources.
#4. What does it mean when you encounter a syntax error?
An error in the syntax of a sequence of characters that is supposed to be in a certain program.
#5. What is a variable? Provide an example of a variable in code.
A symbolic representations of any numbers.
#6. Write a function in Python that when called will print out 
# your name.
print(haleem)
#7. What is a function definition and a function call?
Defining it names the function and specifies what to do when the function is called. Calling the function actually performs the specified actions with the indicated parameters.
#8. Describe what each symbol means?

# = // single equal
# == // double equal
# != // exclaimation equal

#9. What will the output for the following code block be?
var1 = 1
var2 = 2
var3 = "3"

print(var1 + var2 + var3)


#10. What will the output for the following code block be?
listOne = [20, 40, 60, 80]
listTwo = [20, 40, 60, 80]

# 11. Create the following python lists and include the following
# data types for each list:
# a- create a python list of strings. The strings should be items you
# can find in a book bag.
# b- Create a python list of floats. the floats should represent the 
# price of each item in a book bag from the previous list.

# 12. What are the Three (3) naming formats we use for naming variables, files, and functions?
Camelcase, Pascalcase, and Snakecase
# 13. Provide a coding scenario where you would you use a comparison operator in a program?

# 14. Provide a coding scenario Where you would you use a logical operator in a program?

# 15. Create a block of code where you would 
# use a comparison operator with the follwing data:
currentScore= 100
highScore=2300

# Bonus : What does the type() function do?
It returns information about the data structures used to store data elements in a program.
